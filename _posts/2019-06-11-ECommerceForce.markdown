Fully featured web service for online stores, providing convenient and extensible API with detailed documentation

[Source code](https://github.com/zhihaozhangim/EcommerceForce).

What is EcommerceForce all about?

- Created RESTful API with Flask in a Test-first principle, with all the API tested and documented in Postman to ensure easy usability and 100% functionality 
- Stored data in a local SQLite database, using SQLAlchemy as ORM for efficient database query and manipulation
- Implemented E-mail confirmation with Mailgun, and JWT authentication with Flask-JWT-Extended for security
- Applied Stripe API for payment acceptance, OAuth 2.0 for third party login, Flask-Uploads for image uploads
