What is EasyDinning all about?

- Built a responsive user interface that reacts to device screen sizes using Angular and Angular Material
- Applied Firebase as real-time database for the storage and sync of exercise information and for user authentication, leveraging AngularFire to interact with Firebase and monitor authentication state
- Deployed the single page application to Firebase Hosting, implementing lazy loading to faster boot time
