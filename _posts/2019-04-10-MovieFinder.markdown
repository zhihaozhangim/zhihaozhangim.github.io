What is MovieFinder all about?

- Built a file crawler and a indexer with linked list, hash table and inverted index for efficient query processing
- Implemented multi-threading file parsing with Pthreads to improve performance, using mutex to avoid data race
- Developed a web client and a web server using socket programming, with the multiprocessing server handling connections made by multiple clients in parallel
